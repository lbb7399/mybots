# Assignment 7: Random 3D Creature

MAKE SURE SIDEBARS ARE DISABLED

## Creature Body Options

- Shape: cube (or sphere) written with ability to have sphere but I need to figure out how to actually get the sphere so I will be temporarily eliminating that option from shapes in link
- Branching:  1 or 2 new branches for x rounds 
- Branch direction: can branch in 1 of the five other directions. One moving forward and the rest hinged on the edges
- random dimension between 0.1 and 0.6 (maybe place this in constants as well in the form of two constants)
- Sensor: yes or no
- joint: all hinge joints for now dictated by branching directions

So now that this is running more or less:
    - diff joint types
    - spheres
    - maybe figure out how to now overlap
    - or intentional overlap w linear actuators
