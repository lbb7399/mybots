- Shape: cube or sphere
- Branching:  1, or 2 new branches (if zero then that line stops) for 5 rounds (will make parameter in constants for easy change)
- Branch direction: can branch in 1 of the five other directions. For now, have this only happen in the center of each of these planes
- random dimension between 0.1 and 0.6 (maybe place this in constants as well in the form of two constants)
- Sensor: yes or no
- joint: 1 of 2 directions
